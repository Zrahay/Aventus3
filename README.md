PromptArmour: Zero-Day Prompt Injection Firewall
Overview

PromptArmour is a lightweight security middleware designed to protect Large Language Models (LLMs) from prompt injection attacks. As the use of LLMs expands across industries—from customer service to analytics—these models are increasingly vulnerable to malicious inputs that can manipulate their responses, cause data leakage, or override safety protocols.

PromptArmour sits between the user and the LLM, acting as a real-time filter and intelligent firewall. It evaluates prompts for suspicious intent, blocks risky inputs, and logs interactions for future analysis.

The model trained is much better by having 94.8 percent accuracy and 0.3 percent false positive rate comparing it to the current benchmark of 65 percent accuracy and 1 percent false positive rate.
Backend

The backend is built using Node.js, and acts as an API gateway. It captures user input, routes it through middleware checks, and forwards safe prompts to the LLM.

    Entry Point: backend/index.js
    Key Features:
        Middleware for prompt interception
        Routes for submitting and reviewing prompts
        Communication with Flask model backend
    Dependencies: Refer to backend/package.json

Base Model

The base_model directory houses Jupyter notebooks and pretrained models used for training and evaluating binary classifiers that differentiate between malicious and benign prompts.

    Key Files:
        deberta copy.ipynb: DeBERTa Model experimentation and evaluation.
        dataset copy.ipynb: BERT Tiny Model experimentation and evaluation.
        Dataset Source: Patterns derived from datasets like hendzh/PromptShield.

Frontend

The frontend is a React + Vite application that displays the dashboard for monitoring flagged and passed prompts.

    Entry Point: frontend/src/
    Features:
        Live feed of flagged/allowed prompts
        Warning messages for blocked inputs
        Clean dark-themed UI with Tailwind CSS
    Dependencies: Refer to frontend/package.json

Flask App (Model Backend)

The model_backend contains a Flask backend which loads the LLMs for the frontend, along with its middleware binary classifier api (deBERTa model)

    Flask App: app.py
    Dependencies: See requirements.txt
    Features:
        Binary classification for prompt injection
        Semantic similarity checks using embeddings
        Chain-of-thought based intent verification

🚀 Installation Guide — PromptArmour

Follow these steps to set up and run PromptArmour locally:
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptarmour.git
cd promptarmour

2. Setup the Backend (Node.js)

cd backend
npm install
npm start

    📌 This will start the Node.js API gateway responsible for routing prompts and handling middleware.

3. Setup the Frontend (React + Vite)

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

    🎨 This will launch the frontend dashboard on http://localhost:5173 by default.

4. Setup the Model Backend (Flask + ML)

cd ../model_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

    🧠 This starts the Flask server running the prompt injection classifier and intent-checking logic.

Final Step

Ensure all three services are running in parallel:

    Node.js API Gateway → http://localhost:8000
    Flask Model Server → http://localhost:5000
    React Frontend → http://localhost:5173

Now your PromptArmour defense system is live!

Problem Statement

Prompt injection attacks manipulate LLMs through crafted instructions embedded in user inputs. These attacks can cause the model to behave maliciously, leak sensitive data, or override safety protocols. PromptArmour aims to solve this by adding a security layer to catch and block these inputs before they reach the LLM.
